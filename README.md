# DisableTransportBarDemo

A sample project that demonstrates how to disable `AVPlayerViewController` transport bar on tvOS with the intention to roll out a custom transport bar that can be customized with non-standard functionality.

When disabling the transport bar and its associated functionality, be aware of HIG https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/tvos/remote-and-controllers/remote/
